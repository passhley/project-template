# Project Template
This is a base project for a Roblox game using string requires with darklua

# Usage
## Visual Studio Code
Everything is handled through build tasks, on Windows you can press Ctrl+Shift+B (Cmd+Shift+B on MacOS)
to run the package install task, as well as the build watch task.
## Neovim
You can use the bash scripts inside `scripts` to have the same workflow as on VS Code.
